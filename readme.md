In this repo I keep all react project which I did in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMknfKXIFA8&t=8534s) course. They are not my own project(not invented by me) so I did not want to create the single repo for each project.

## word of conclusion
Finally I have finshed this course, to be honest it was the best course which I have done so far. There is a one extra project to do - of course I am going to do it, but I will create a new repo for it, cuz there is a bit of a mess. I just want to check myself if I can create the project from scratch while maintaining the readability of the code and a nice history in git.
